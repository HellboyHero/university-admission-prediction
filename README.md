# University Admission Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the chances of a student's admission to a university based on their academic scores and standardized test results. It leverages machine learning techniques to build a predictive model using real-world data and helps students estimate their likelihood of admission to their desired university.

## ✨ Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming input data for better model performance.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing trends and correlations in admission data.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Predicting admission chances using regression techniques.
- **Model Evaluation:** Measuring performance using metrics like R² and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Interactive Visualization (optional):** Graphical representation of predictions.



## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python** (Core Programming Language)
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Analysis)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Development Environment)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
### **1. Clone the repository**

git clone https://github.com/HellboyHero/university-admission-prediction.git
cd university-admission-prediction
2. Create & activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
3. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run Jupyter Notebook

jupyter notebook
Open the notebook and execute cells to see analysis and predictions.

📊 Dataset
The dataset includes parameters like GRE Score, TOEFL Score, University Rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, and Research experience.

These features are used to predict the Chance of Admit (ranging from 0 to 1).

🔮 Future Enhancements
Deploy the model as a web app using Flask/Django.

Integrate a live form for students to input scores and get predictions.

Improve model accuracy using advanced algorithms like Random Forest or XGBoost.
